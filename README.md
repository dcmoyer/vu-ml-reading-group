This will be a link to [sign up for the email listserv](https://github.com/dcmoyer/vu-ml-reading-group) but right now it's just a dead link.

Current meeting time: Monday 3-4pm Central

## Submitting to the Paper Queue

For now, submit a github issue to add papers to the queue. As a group we'll select the next paper to read (either in person, or via email/slack/teams/dictatorial fiat). If it gets too crowded, we'll set up a tag system.
